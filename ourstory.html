<p>The tireless workers here at Dream Time Machine believe no wall should remain blank. The Dream Team works day and night to ensure your walls are never boring and you’re deep dreaming experience is top notch
</p>


<h2 id="table-of-contents">Our Story</h2>
<p> One day during class, our friend Christian found a disturbing, and project-altering video. Thus, the Dream Team was born. Inspired by Deeply Artificial Trees, we wanted to create a trippy, interactive, music-visualizing experience for our users.
Follow us through our journey to see how we got to our final project.
</p>
<p>
First, we decided we wanted to use Google’s deep dream algorithm to alter live footage of the people watching our video in real time, such that the people would be confused about what’s happening to the feed.
After playing around with the deep dream algorithm, we realized that it takes too long to run on a single image for it to be able to distort a live camera feed, so we took our first pivot.
After getting feedback from the rest of our class, we decided it was important for the project to have some live aspect, respond to the music, look super trippy, and give the illusion of a video.
So, we decided to preload images altered using our deep dream notebook and stitch them together in the live version to create the illusion of a video. 
We also decided to pursue creating different modes because our classmates seemed excited about that aspect of our project. 
Overlayed on top of this background video is an outline version of the live camera feed to give the interactive feel.
From there, we worked on changing aspects of the video to reflect what’s happening in the song.
Now the video detects faces in the live feed and creates circles radiating out from the middle of their face that change size with the beats of the song.

<h2 id = "inclusivity"> Inclusivity Statement</h2>
<p>
Our project is designed to bridge the gap at parties between those who drink and those who do not by making everyone feel much drunker.
