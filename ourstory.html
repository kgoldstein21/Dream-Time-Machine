<h2 id="table-of-contents">Our Story</h2>
<p> One day during class, our friend Christian found a disturbing, and project-altering video. Thus, the Dream Team was born. Inspired by Deeply Artificial Trees, we wanted to create a trippy, interactive, music-visualizing experience for our users. Follow us through our journey to see how we got to our final project. 
First, we decided we wanted to use Google’s deep dream algorithm to alter live footage of the people watching our video in real time, such that the people would be confused about what’s happening to the feed. After playing around with the algorithm, we realized that it takes too long to run on a single image for it to be able to run on a live video, so we took our first pivot. We decided it was important for the project to have some live aspect, respond to the music, and look super trippy and give the illusion of a video. So, we decided to preload videos of deep dreamed images as our background, and overlay an outline version of the live camera feed on top. 
From there, we worked on changing aspects of the video to reflect what’s happening in the song. Right now, the program changes the size of the circle at the same time as the beat of the song.
